# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reimplementing the complete Blockstream Green Development Kit (GDK) as a pure Rust crate named 'gdk-rs'. The original GDK is a cross-platform C/C++ library for building Bitcoin and Liquid Network wallets. Our goal is to create a fully compatible, idiomatic Rust implementation that provides all the functionality of the original GDK while leveraging Rust's safety guarantees, ergonomics, and ecosystem. The implementation will be self-contained, reimplementing Bitcoin and Liquid primitives internally rather than depending on external crates like rust-bitcoin or rust-elements.

## Requirements

6. WHEN get_previous_addresses is called THEN the system SHALL return previously generated addresses with their usage status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Liquid Network user, I want to manage assets and confidential transactions, so that I can work with various tokens on the Liquid sidechain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refresh_assets is called THEN the system SHALL update the local asset registry from the network
2. WHEN get_assets is called THEN the system SHALL return all known assets with their metadata
3. WHEN validate_asset_domain_name is called THEN the system SHALL verify asset domain associations
4. WHEN blind_transaction is called THEN the system SHALL create confidential transactions with blinded amounts
5. WHEN working with Liquid transactions THEN the system SHALL handle asset IDs, blinding factors, and range proofs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to create, sign, and broadcast transactions, so that I can send Bitcoin and Liquid assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN get_transactions is called THEN the system SHALL return paginated transaction history

7. WHEN broadcast_transaction is called THEN the system SHALL submit the transaction to the network
8. WHEN send_transaction is called THEN the system SHALL perform the complete create-sign-broadcast flow

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating hardware wallets, I want to support external signers, so that users can securely sign transactions with their hardware devices.

3. WHEN PSBT signing is requested THEN the system SHALL support Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
4. WHEN PSET signing is requested THEN the system SHALL support Partially Signed Elements Transactions for Liquid

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a wallet application, I want to receive real-time notifications about blockchain events, so that I can update the UI and respond to changes.

5. WHEN notifications are triggered THEN the system SHALL use Rust channels or callback mechanisms

### Requirement 9

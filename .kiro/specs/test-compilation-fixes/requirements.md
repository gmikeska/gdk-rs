# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GDK Rust library has multiple compilation errors in its test suite that prevent successful testing. The errors primarily stem from missing method implementations in core types like `LoginCredentials`, `TransactionBuilder`, and `Script`, as well as missing trait implementations. This feature will systematically address all compilation errors to restore a fully functional test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to compile successfully, so that I can run the complete test suite without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cargo test --all-features --all` THEN the system SHALL compile all test files without errors
2. WHEN compilation completes THEN the system SHALL proceed to execute tests rather than failing at compilation stage
3. IF there are missing method implementations THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate implementations or stubs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `LoginCredentials` type to support all authentication methods used in tests, so that authentication-related tests can execute properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call `LoginCredentials::from_mnemonic` THEN the system SHALL provide a working implementation
2. WHEN tests call `LoginCredentials::from_pin` THEN the system SHALL provide a working implementation  
3. WHEN tests call `LoginCredentials::from_watch_only_user` THEN the system SHALL provide a working implementation
4. IF any authentication method is called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate `LoginCredentials` instances

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `TransactionBuilder` type to support all transaction construction methods used in tests, so that transaction-related tests can execute properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call transaction builder methods like `add_input`, `add_output`, `build` THEN the system SHALL provide working implementations
2. WHEN tests call accessor methods like `inputs()`, `outputs()`, `network()` THEN the system SHALL return appropriate values
3. WHEN tests call configuration methods like `set_fee_rate`, `set_lock_time` THEN the system SHALL store and apply the configurations
4. WHEN tests call utility methods like `estimate_size`, `estimate_fee` THEN the system SHALL provide reasonable estimates
5. IF witness data is added THEN the system SHALL properly handle witness information in transactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `Script` type to support all script construction methods used in tests, so that script-related tests can execute properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call `Script::new_op_return` THEN the system SHALL create appropriate OP_RETURN scripts
2. IF script construction methods are missing THEN the system SHALL implement them following Bitcoin script standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all types to implement necessary traits for testing, so that test assertions and debugging work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests format types with `{:?}` THEN the system SHALL provide `Debug` trait implementations
2. WHEN tests clone builder objects THEN the system SHALL provide `Clone` trait implementations
3. IF any trait is required for testing THEN the system SHALL implement it appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused import warnings to be cleaned up, so that the codebase maintains high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT generate unused import warnings
2. IF imports are unused THEN the system SHALL remove them from test files
3. WHEN cleaning imports THEN the system SHALL preserve all necessary imports for functionality

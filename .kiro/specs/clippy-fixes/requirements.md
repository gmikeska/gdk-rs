# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GDK Rust library has extensive clippy warnings and errors when run with strict linting rules (`cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery -W rust-2018-idioms`). The analysis reveals over 52,000 lines of clippy output with hundreds of different types of issues including format string inefficiencies, missing documentation, large error types, redundant code patterns, and style violations. This feature will systematically address all clippy warnings and errors to achieve a clean, high-quality codebase that follows Rust best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all format string usage to be efficient and modern, so that the codebase follows current Rust formatting best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clippy analyzes format strings THEN the system SHALL use direct variable interpolation instead of positional arguments
2. WHEN format strings contain variables THEN the system SHALL use `format!("text {variable}")` instead of `format!("text {}", variable)`
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `uninlined_format_args` warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all public functions that return `Result` to have proper error documentation, so that API users understand when and why functions can fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a public function returns `Result<T, E>` THEN the system SHALL include a `# Errors` section in its documentation
2. WHEN the `# Errors` section exists THEN it SHALL describe the conditions under which the function returns errors
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `missing_errors_doc` warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions that may panic to have proper panic documentation, so that API users understand when functions might panic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a public function may panic THEN the system SHALL include a `# Panics` section in its documentation
2. WHEN the `# Panics` section exists THEN it SHALL describe the conditions under which the function panics
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `missing_panics_doc` warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error type to be appropriately sized, so that Result types don't consume excessive memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `GdkError` enum is used in `Result` types THEN the system SHALL NOT exceed reasonable size limits
2. WHEN error variants are large THEN the system SHALL use boxing or other techniques to reduce size
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `result_large_err` warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions that could be const to be marked as const, so that they can be used in const contexts and compile-time evaluation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function's implementation allows const evaluation THEN the system SHALL mark it with `const fn`
2. WHEN functions are marked const THEN they SHALL still maintain their existing behavior
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `could_be_const_fn` warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functions that return useful values to be marked with `#[must_use]`, so that callers don't accidentally ignore important return values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function returns a value that should typically be used THEN the system SHALL mark it with `#[must_use]`
2. WHEN functions are marked `#[must_use]` THEN callers SHALL receive warnings if they ignore the return value
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `must_use_candidate` warnings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want redundant code patterns to be eliminated, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN match arms have identical bodies THEN the system SHALL combine them into a single arm
2. WHEN else blocks are redundant THEN the system SHALL remove them
3. WHEN continue expressions are redundant THEN the system SHALL remove them
4. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate redundancy warnings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want async functions to only be async when necessary, so that the codebase doesn't have unnecessary async overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an async function contains no await statements THEN the system SHALL remove the async modifier
2. WHEN async is removed THEN the function SHALL maintain the same behavior for callers
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `unused_async` warnings

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mutable references to only be used when mutation is necessary, so that the code clearly indicates intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function parameter is `&mut self` but doesn't mutate THEN the system SHALL change it to `&self`
2. WHEN mutable references are changed to immutable THEN the function SHALL maintain the same behavior
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `needless_pass_by_ref_mut` warnings

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want numeric literals to be readable, so that large numbers are easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN numeric literals are long THEN the system SHALL add separators for readability
2. WHEN separators are added THEN the numeric values SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `unreadable_literal` warnings

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want variable names to be distinct, so that code is clear and not confusing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variable names are too similar THEN the system SHALL rename them to be more distinct
2. WHEN variables are renamed THEN their functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `similar_names` warnings

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file extension comparisons to be case-insensitive where appropriate, so that the code handles different case variations correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing file extensions THEN the system SHALL use case-insensitive comparison
2. WHEN case-insensitive comparison is used THEN it SHALL handle all case variations correctly
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `case_sensitive_file_extension_comparisons` warnings

### Requirement 13

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type casting to be safe and explicit, so that potential data loss is handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN casting between numeric types THEN the system SHALL use `try_from` for potentially lossy conversions
2. WHEN safe casting is not possible THEN the system SHALL use explicit allow attributes with justification
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `cast_possible_truncation` warnings

### Requirement 14

**User Story:** As a developer, I want temporary values with significant drops to be handled efficiently, so that resource contention is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary values have significant `Drop` implementations THEN the system SHALL minimize their lifetime
2. WHEN lifetimes are optimized THEN the functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN running clippy THEN the system SHALL NOT generate `significant_drop_tightening` warnings

### Requirement 15

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to pass all clippy checks with strict settings, so that it maintains the highest code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic -W clippy::nursery -W rust-2018-idioms` THEN the system SHALL complete without any warnings or errors
2. WHEN clippy passes THEN all code quality improvements SHALL be applied consistently across the codebase
3. WHEN changes are made THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact
